## Overview

Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) are essential for efficient problem-solving in programming. This repository provides Python implementations of common data structures and algorithms, along with explanations and examples to aid learning.

## Data Structures

### Arrays
- **Description**: A collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations.
- **Implementation**: Includes basic operations such as insertion, deletion, and traversal.

### Linked Lists
- **Description**: A linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, with each node pointing to the next.
- **Implementation**: Singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.

### Stacks
- **Description**: A Last In, First Out (LIFO) data structure.
- **Implementation**: Includes push, pop, peek, and traversal methods.

### Queues
- **Description**: A First In, First Out (FIFO) data structure.
- **Implementation**: Includes enqueue, dequeue, and traversal methods.

### Trees
- **Description**: A hierarchical data structure with nodes connected by edges.
- **Implementation**: Binary trees, binary search trees, and tree traversal methods (in-order, pre-order, post-order).

### Graphs
- **Description**: A collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges.
- **Implementation**: Adjacency list and adjacency matrix representations, along with traversal methods like Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS).

### Hash Tables
- **Description**: A data structure that implements an associative array abstract data type, a structure that can map keys to values.
- **Implementation**: Includes basic operations like insert, delete, and search.

## Algorithms

### Sorting Algorithms
- **Description**: Algorithms that arrange the elements in a list or array in a certain order.
- **Implementations**: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and more.

### Searching Algorithms
- **Description**: Algorithms used to find specific values within data structures.
- **Implementations**: Linear Search, Binary Search, and others.

### Dynamic Programming
- **Description**: A method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems.
- **Implementations**: Examples include Fibonacci series, knapsack problem, and others.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-dsa.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd python-dsa
   ```

3. **Run the scripts**:
   You can execute the scripts or import the modules in your Python projects as needed.

   ```python
   from data_structures import Stack
   stack = Stack()
   stack.push(10)
   print(stack.pop())
   ```
