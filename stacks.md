# Stack Data Structure Implementation in Python

This project provides a basic implementation of a **Stack** data structure using a singly linked list. The `Stack` class supports common stack operations, such as **push**, **pop**, **traverse**, **peek**, and checking if the stack is empty. Each element in the stack is represented by a `Node`, where the data and a reference to the next node in the stack are stored.

## Classes

### Node

The `Node` class represents an individual element in the stack.

#### Constructor

```python
def __init__(self, value):
    self.data = value
    self.next = None

# Stack Implementation using Linked List

This project implements a **Stack** data structure using a **Linked List** in Python. It consists of two classes: `Node` and `Stack`. The `Node` class represents an individual element in the stack, while the `Stack` class manages the stack operations like **push**, **pop**, **peak**, and **traverse**.

## Overview

A **stack** is a Last In, First Out (LIFO) data structure, meaning the last element added to the stack is the first one to be removed. This project demonstrates the stack's functionality using linked nodes rather than arrays or lists, allowing for dynamic size growth.

## Classes

### Node Class

The `Node` class represents each element in the stack. It has two attributes:

- **data**: Stores the value of the node.
- **next**: Points to the next node in the stack.

### Stack Class

The `Stack` class implements the stack operations. It uses a linked list to keep track of the elements, with the top of the stack represented by the `top` pointer.

## Methods

### isempty()
- **Description**: Checks whether the stack is empty.
- **Returns**: `True` if the stack is empty, `False` otherwise.

### push(value)
- **Description**: Adds a new element to the top of the stack.
- **Parameters**: `value` - The data to be added to the stack.
- **Behavior**: Creates a new node with the given value and pushes it onto the stack by linking it to the current top node.

### traverse()
- **Description**: Prints all elements in the stack starting from the top.
- **Behavior**: Traverses through each node in the stack and prints its data.

### peak()
- **Description**: Returns the top element of the stack without removing it.
- **Returns**: The data of the top element, or "stack empty" if the stack is empty.

### pop()
- **Description**: Removes and returns the top element of the stack.
- **Returns**: The data of the removed element, or "stack empty" if the stack is empty.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stack-implementation.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
   ```bash
   cd stack-implementation
   ```

3. **Run the script**:
   You can use this implementation by creating an instance of the `Stack` class and using its methods:

   ```python
   stack = Stack()
   stack.push(10)
   stack.push(20)
   stack.push(30)

   print("Stack elements:")
   stack.traverse()

   print("Top element:", stack.peak())

   print("Popped element:", stack.pop())
   ```
